title: "Introduction: An overview of the Cypress Launchpad"
permalink: /introduction/
---

This repo is intended to be used for an internal portfolio review over the use of Cypress as observed by Ultranaut team member Austin Bell. In an effort to hightlight and demonstrate lessons learned from Ultranaut projects, this repo was designed in mind to make it relatively simplistic in design and implementation, as well as adding a touch of modern capabilities to stand out.

### Theme Considerations : Github Pages and Jekyll

Using the [Reverie Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) in conjunction with the Github pages feature, this enables the project repo to essentially stylize itself within the Jekyll framework, without spending too much time on design choices with a predetermined rendering of markdown pages. The Cypress Launchpad is merely a demonstration of team member's capabilities, and does not need to be a completely built from scratch when "free" templates are available for use that offer a touch of professionalism.

Github pages allow for Jekyll projects to be hosted without much further set up, and content can easily be added depending on pages or posts added to the respective "_pages" and _posts" directories.

### Recommended Reviewing

This repo space is intended to be reviewed by team members who have a familiar understanding of the Cypress.io testing framework, as well as a comfortable understanding of Javascript to understand the topic points covered in the posts. (This section maybe updatedwith additional prerequisites as needed for someeone who needs full context and understanding of topics covered in this portfolio repo.)
